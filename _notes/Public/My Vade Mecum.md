# Welcome to my Vade Mecum of Life. 

It began with the need of an outside influence to provide some tether to reality when I was struggling with mental health issues. The first document was [[Look Here]], a tool that in its current iteration has evolved in the specifics but continue to serve its specific function.

From there, I added writings and quotes and images that I found helpful. 

My Vade Mecum has proven invaluable and, as a secular spiritualist, it has become my holy book. Sacred in what it provides but never dogmatic or stagnant in its content. 

Because I've found this tool to be indispensable in my own life, I want to share both its contents and its underlying philosophy with others. My hope is that there is someone who also needs this as much as I did when I started. I'm also creating a for guidance on how to create a Vade Mecum that is central to your own life (a Vademecum Vademecum, if you will).

As Merriam-Webster so keenly points out, we can now carry a variety of reference in our pockets these days. A personal Vade Mecum may prove far more useful than most content vying for our attention on our mobile devices. 

May you find this tool a useful touchstone to help ground, center, and inspire.
