# All the way to the wilderness

We can never understand it all. Sometimes, glimpses. Other times, frustration and anger. Follow the path. Not just part of the way but "all the way to the wilderness." That is truly living.


> What makes you think you should understand it all?...That's a lesson you have to learn, instead of being angry all the time. We'll never know exactly why we are, what we are, and so on. All you can do is follow your path all the way to the wilderness, and then you continue along because that's what must be.

~ from [[Who Fears Death]] by [[Nnedi Okorafor]]
