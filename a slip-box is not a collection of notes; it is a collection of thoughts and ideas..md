# a slip-box is not a collection of notes; it is a collection of thoughts and ideas.

The slip-box works best as a second brain, not a second notebook. Rather than containing only the spark to our own thinking, our notes should lean heavily on creating a living system of our actual thoughts (not a collection of the sparks).

For me, it's also important to situate my thoughts into the larger context, the larger conversation. So notes and external links will always be core to my Evergreen notes as well. Yet not in lieu of taking the time to write towards my own understanding of the topic(s) at hand.
