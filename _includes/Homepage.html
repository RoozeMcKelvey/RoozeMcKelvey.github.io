    <h1>Vade Mecum</h1>

<h2>This is my <a href="/notes/defined">Vade Mecum</a> of Life. </h2>


<p>It began with the need of an outside influence to provide some tether to reality when I was struggling with mental health issues. The first document was [[~ Look Here]], a tool that in its current iteration has evolved in the specifics but continue to serve its specific function.</p>

<p>From there, I added writings ( #vademecum/anthology) that I found helpful. And images ( #vademecum/image).</p>

<p>My Vade Mecum has proven invaluable and, as a secular spiritualist, it has become my holy book. Sacred in what it provides but never dogmatic or stagnant in its content. </p>

<p>Because I've found this tool to be indispensable in my own life, I've reached a point where I want to share both its contents and its underlying philosophy with others. My hope is that there is someone who also needs this as much as I did when I started. I'm also creating a for guidance on how to create a Vade Mecum that is central to your own life (a Vademecum Vademecum, if you will).</p>

<p>As Merriam-Webster so keenly points out, we can now carry a variety of reference in our pockets these days. A personal Vade Mecum may prove far more useful than most content vying for our attention on our mobile devices. </p>

<p>May you find this tool a useful touchstone to help ground, center, and inspire. </p>
